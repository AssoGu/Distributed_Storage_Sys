Init:
On proxy node:
1) call dss_app:start(), choose proxy in gui

On storage nodes:
1) call dss_app:start(), choose storage in gui, enter proxy node ip and capacity(currently in kb,need to be fixed)


Flow - upload/downloading from/to another storage node,

use menu.

to do-

1) if the same node rejoining the ring we do not add him again to the ring to avoid multiple vnodes (need to perform check in statisticsDB)

2) FIX terminate procedure:
%% Exit Flow:
%%  1. Call exit node of proxy genserver call.
%%  2.  Triggering proxy genserver
%%  3.    delete the node from the ring of the load balancer
%%        re balance the ring
%%        storage_genserver_calls:exit_node
%%  4.      use genserver terminate to exit the node
